Clean Code book suggested to reduce the number of arguments (max 2). Suppose we have more than 2 arguments than how we can handle this?

(a) Passing arguments as single array
(b) Use global variables.
(C) Create an object to encapsulate arguments
(d) Use default values for extra argument.



Why the use of boolean arguments in functions are not allowed according to book?

(a) Execution of function will be slow 
(b) This will lead the function to perform more than 1 task
(c) This will lead to unexpected results
(d) Hard to unit test the function.
